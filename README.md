# 24hrs-Digital-Clock
This project implements a 24-hour digital clock on the Nexys A7 board using the Verilog language. The time is displayed on six seven-segment displays. The first two displays show the hours in 24-hour format, the second two displays show the minutes, and the third two displays show the seconds.
